## Ingredients 

For 9 egg tarts

*   1 sheet puff pastry 
*   1/2 cup whole milk  
*   40g sugar 
*   1 egg yolk 
*   1 egg 
*   3/4 cup heavy whipping cream 

## Tools 
whisk, two bowls, fine mesh strainer, rolling pin, muffin pan. 


## Steps 

- Tart shells 

1. Defrost the puff pastry following the package instruction.
2. Dust some flour, gently roll the sheet until slightly larger (approx 1" larger on each sides).
3. Tap the top with wet kitchen towel to get rid of additional flour. 
4. Start rolling the sheet from one side, tightly roll up to a cyclinder. 
5. Equally cut the roll to 9 pieces. 
6. Spray the muffin pan. (You can use the liners but the shape may not be as pretty.) 
6. Start with one piece, roll out to a circle with thinner center and thicker sides. 
7. Move the rolled out dough to the muffin pan, make sure it's slightly oversize since it will shrink in the oven.  
8. Repeat for the rest. Once finished, move the pan back to the fridge. 

- Tart filling 

1. Pour milk into one bowl, warm in the microwave for 30 seconds. 
2. Add sugar, mix until resolved. 
3. Add yolk and the full egg into another bowl. Beaten until yolk and whites combined. 
4. Pour the eggs into milk mixture, add heavy cream, mix until combined. 
5. Use the strainer to sift the liquid mixture at least twice. The final mixture should have no bubbles left. 

- Assemble

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. 
2. Take out tart shells, pour the mixture in to about 90% full. 
3. Bake for 25 minutes, or start seeing dark spots on the surface. 
4. Cool down for 10m, enjoy!
